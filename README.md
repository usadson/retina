# ‚ú® Retina - A Browser Engine Project üîó
Retina is a fresh approach to web browser engines, written entirely in Rust. It aims to stay close to web standards and specifications, focusing on correctness, performance, and safety. This is a monorepo that contains the main binary `retina`, alongside several libraries that define different aspects of the browser's operations.

## üì¶Ô∏è Components
* [`retina`](retina) - The main application entry point.
* [`retina-common`](retina-common) - Shared types and utilities used across other libraries.
* [`retina-compositor`](retina-compositor) - Responsible for drawing the layout to the screen.
* [`retina-dom`](retina-dom) - Implements the [Document Object Model](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/), managing and manipulating the tree structure of the webpage.
* [`retina-fetch`](retina-fetch) - Responsible for making HTTP requests to retrieve resources over the internet. This implements the [Fetch API](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/)
* [`retina-gfx`](retina-gfx) - Graphics subsystem for both the compositor and the GUI.
* [`retina-layout`](retina-layout) - Implements the CSS box model and layout algorithms.
* [`retina-page`](retina-page) - Orchestrates the creation and management of web pages.
* [`retina-style`](retina-style) - Implements the CSS representation.
* [`retina-style-computation`](retina-style-computation) - Computes the final style of the elements based on CSS rules.
* [`retina-style-parser`](retina-style-parser) - Parses CSS stylesheets and inline styles.
* [`retina-user-agent`](retina-user-agent) - Handles the behavior and identity of the web browser, and also specifies the browser/implementation-specific behavior.

## üèÉ Process Flow
This section describes the current process flow, which is currently simple but is crafted in such a way
that a multi-page and multi-process architecture is eventually possible, without coupling these too much
to the current single-page architecture.
1. __retina__ starts up, creates a window and a page
2. __retina-page__ resolves the URL and starts a page load
3. __retina-fetch__ loads the HTML contents of the URL
4. __retina-page__ invokes __retina-dom__
5. __retina-dom__ parses the HTML and constructs a DOM tree
6. __retina-page__ collects the stylesheets
7. __retina-page__ invokes __retina-style__
8. __retina-style_parser__ parses the CSS associated with these stylesheets
9. __retina-page__ invokes __retina-layout__
10. __retina-layout__ invokes __retina-style-computation__
11. __retina-style-computation__ resolves and computes the style per element
12. __retina-layout__ creates a CSS Box tree per element using the computed style
13. __retina-page__ invokes __retina-compositor__
14. __retina-compositor__ sends drawing commands to __retina-gfx__ using the Box tree
15. __retina-gfx__ translates the draw commands to `wgpu`-specific calls
16. __retina-gfx__ executes these commands on the page surface
17. `wgpu` invokes the underlying graphics library (OpenGL, Vulkan, etc.)
18. __retina-page__ sends a texture view of the page surface to the main process
19. __retina__ calls __retina-gfx__ to paint this texture view to the window surface
